# Swiggy_Automation_Selenium
This script automates logging into Swiggy, selecting an item, adding it to the cart, and navigating to checkout. It handles manual OTP entry, waits for elements to load properly, and ensures smooth execution with Selenium's explicit waits. A small delay is added before proceeding to checkout for better stability.
